## I. Identify a Common Vision
We want to create a game that helps young musicians practice. It would serve as supplementary tool to motivate students outside of classroom settings. 

### Commonalities
We as a group are all interested in music, improving access to education, game design, mobile apps, art, and fun, which all relate to this project. We're excited to create mobile app that can be free and accessible to budding musicians.

### Inspiration
We drew our original inspiration from Anna's bassoon teacher Janet, who suggested the general idea for an app that would give young students more motivation to practice -- "anything for you, Janet." Having played musical games growing up (like Guitar Hero and Rhythm Heaven), we feel like Practice Perfect would be the next step in this genre of games. 

### Problems of Interest
Lack of motivation for young musicians is the main problem, along with access to practice materials and instruction from teachers. 


### Identify
All of the above interest us equally!! :) 


## II. Narrow In
1. Scales, arpeggios, tuning
2. Practicing songs
3. Homework
4. Group mode (scoreboards)

### Problem Statement
It's hard for young musicians to find the motivation to practice outside of their lessons and rehearsals. 


### Rephrase
We want to provide a platform for students to practice that would increase their motivation to practice and skill at playing their instruments.


### Reframe
1. How might we FORCE the young musicians to practice? 
1. How might we make the kids ADDICTED to practicing? 
1. How might we encourage older musicians to return to their instruments?  
1. As teachers, how might we assign homework to our students?
1. How might we digitize playing music? 

### Choose
1. How might we make the kids ADDICTED to practicing? 

#### Coolness
The psychology of making something that wasn't enjoyable now enjoyable. What makes an addictive app? Constant feedback and competition? 

#### Challenges
Generating the graphics could be challenging. Also, making a game that's fun but doesn't distract from practicing will be hard (balancing gameplay with educational content).

#### Success
Legally classified as an addiction. But also getting good reviews from students and teachers, and seeing that students organically come back to the app and improve over time. 


## III. Survey the State of the Art
Other apps like Guitar Hero, Yousician, and Modacity provide the functionality of either a game or a practice app, but none of them quite meet the definition of what we hope to create for our project: a game AND practice app. 

### Similar Goals
Similar apps already exist, but they're targeted towards an older audience and are more about correctness than encouragement. They aren't gamified and might not be as ideal for younger audiences as our idea is. 

### Differences
Our app will gamify practicing and provide encouragement to students that other apps do not. 

### Inspiration
Guitar Hero and Yousician are two apps from which we will draw inspiration. We aim to expand their scope to apply to instruments other than guitar and bass, and also to improve the gameplay.
